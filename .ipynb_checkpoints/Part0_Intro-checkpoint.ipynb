    "In this assignment we'll learn to generate text with a deep multilayer RNN network based on GRU cells.\n",
    "Then we'll focus our attention on image generation using a variational autoencoder.\n",
    "We will then shift our focus to sentiment analysis: First by training a transformer-style encoder, and then by fine-tuning a pre-trained model from Hugging Face."

    "\n",
    "- Please read the [getting started page](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/assignments/getting-started) on the course website. It explains how to **setup, run and submit** the assignment.\n",
    "- This assignment requires running on GPU-enabled hardware. Please read the [course servers usage guide](https://vistalab-technion.github.io/cs236781/assignments/hpc-servers). It explains how to use and run your code on the course servers to benefit from training with GPUs.\n",
    "- The text and code cells in these notebooks are intended to guide you through the\n",
    "  assignment and help you verify your solutions.\n",
    "  The notebooks **do not need to be edited** at all (unless you wish to play around).\n",
    "  The only exception is to fill your name(s) in the above cell before submission.\n",
    "  Please do not remove sections or change the order of any cells.\n",
    "- All your code (and even answers to questions) should be written in the files\n",
    "  within the python package corresponding the assignment number (`hw1`, `hw2`, etc).\n",
    "  You can of course use any editor or IDE to work on these files.\n"
